[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/github/remix-run/react-router-templates/tree/main/default)

## Features

- 🚀 Server-side rendering
- ⚡️ Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- 📦 Asset bundling and optimization
- 🔄 Data loading and mutations
- 🔒 TypeScript by default
- 🎉 TailwindCSS for styling
- 📖 [React Router docs](https://reactrouter.com/)

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

To build and run using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t my-app .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app
```

The containerized application can be deployed to any platform that supports Docker, including:

- AWS ECS
- Google Cloud Run
- Azure Container Apps
- Digital Ocean App Platform
- Fly.io
- Railway

### DIY Deployment

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

│   └── server/    # Server-side code
```

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever CSS framework you prefer.

Built with ❤️ using React Router.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How I created the whole app

First Installed webstorm (IDE)
After that I create a project named as "ai_resume_analyzer" with empty activity
then I go to vite.dev site and get command "npm create vite@latest ."
Using this command it creates a vite project, it asks few things like framework
as react and after that reach router v7, and after that agree for GitHub repository and after
that it will load some files. After completing that write this command in terminal to run the project
"npm run dev". Another command for tailwind css "npm install -D tw-animate-css". It is for creating cool css animations.
"npm install clsx tailwind-merge pdfjs-dist zustand".

There are multiple files (For what purpose)
1) vite.config.ts: This file contains vite configuration for the project,
and we also have 3 plugins setup (tailwindcss(For styling), reactrouter(For Rounting), tsconfigpaths(For type safety)).
2) react-router.config.ts: This file is for router configuration options for React making use of server side rendering.
3) tsconfig.json: This file contains the rules that TypeScript will use to enforce type safety throughout the project.
4) package.json: This file contains all of our dependencies.
5) dockerfile: Automatically generated by vite, letting you host your app inside a docker container.
6) .dockerignore, .gitignore: This file is to make sure that you don't push any secret to GitHub.
7) public: It contains all assets.
8) node modules: It contains all of our dependencies and some additional react router metadata
